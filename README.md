 This plugin allows setting a default custom URL to be used as canonical. It is designed to work with Yoast SEO only. 

== Description ==
Defining your default canonical arbitrary is most useful for those unfortunate souls who have their site URLs in punycode. This plugin allows setting a default custom URL to be used as canonical. It is designed to work with Yoast SEO only. The individual settings are still available and can be edited as before. Since it is dependent on presence of Yoast SEO, this plugin will not activate without it.
The plugin does not add its own settings page, It uses WordPress Settings -> General. Look for it at the bottom of that page.

== Installation ==
Installation is standard WordPress â€” upload in Plugins page, activate.

== Changelog ==
Version 1.0, Initial release.
